Bioinformatics to do list ChIPmentation:
 
1) Sequencing-related
	a. Table of experiments and mapped reads
	b. Mapping
		i. Quality control of reads
		ii. Determine optimal mapping parameters with favorite program
		iii. Map all sequencing
	c. Sequence bias introduced by tagmentase
2) Visualization of raw data
	a. UCSC track hubs (normal)
	b. UCSC track hubs (for footprinting)
3) Standard analysis
	a. Peak finding
	b. Compare “normal” ChIP-seq and ChIPmentation experiments
		i. Scatter plots
		ii. Correlations
		iii. ENCODE peaks recovered? Venn diagrams
		iv. Also compare biological replicates
4) ChIPmentation special analysis
	a. Histones
		i. Detection of TATA-box and related features in H3K4me3 data
		ii. Can we find other sequence features in histone data
		iii. Can we infer something from this information?
		iv. Compare to DNase HS data
	b. Transcription factors
		i. Footprint description (CTCF, PU.1 etc) with histogram
		ii. Visualization (UCSC single bp resolution)
		iii. Develop new peakfinder for “dip”? Performance to detect motifs?
		iv. Can we find other sequence features with this technique and/or use it to make some interesting observations:
			1. E.g. confirm DNase footprints
			2. E.g. learn sth. about the physical interaction of the factor with DNA
			3. E.g. find co-binding factors/regulatory “modules” by systematically analyzing footprints adjacent to “main footprint” in a transcription factor binding peak
			4. Fragment length inclusion
				a. Mnase-pattern plot distance from peak vs. frag length
				b. Identify actual TF-binding site (short fragments) vs. distal footprints (longer fragments)
			5. …what else?
5) ChIPmentation sensitivity
	a. Visualization of raw data
		i. UCSC track hubs (normal)
		ii. UCSC track hubs (for footprinting)
	b. Standard analysis
		i. Peak finding
		ii. Compare 500k and 10k cell experiments
			1. Scatter plots
			2. Correlations
			3. ENCODE peaks recovered? Venn diagrams
			4. Also compare biological replicates
