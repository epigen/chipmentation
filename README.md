ChIPmentation
=====

Code for the Schmidl2015 'ChIPmentation' project
-----
Here's the code for the project.

Start with `src/main.sh` which will call some of the code in `src/pipelines,scripts,lib` etc...

I'm rewriting some parts of the code more specific to this analysis making use of Python and libraries such as HTSeq and pybedtools for efficiency and clarity.
